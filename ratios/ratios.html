<h1>Homework 6, Part 2: Census data ratios and categories </h1>
<h2>Kate Livesay</h2>

<h2>Ratio Information</h2>
<h3>For my ratio, I chose to use the total number of households in the CSV data set that were selected in the study on electricity in households. For my ratio specifically, I divided the number of households per county that spent over $250 a month on electricity bills by the total number of households that data was collected on for that survey.</h3>

<h2>Ratios— Equal Interval</h2>
<h3>This ratio map uses the classification scheme of Equal Interval. The data values become divided equally into a various number of categories. A pro of this category is that there are no gaps in the legend of the data, and it is easy to visualize. A con of equal interval is the fact that it fails to show, in quantity, how data is distributed across the minimum and the maximum values.</h3>

<h2>Ratios— Natural Breaks</h2>
<h3>This ratio maps uses the classification scheme of Natural Breaks. The data values become naturally divided into categories that are specific to that data set. A pro of this classification is that it is mostly accurate toward the data in the way that it is able to identify naturally occurring classes within the data. A con of this classification is that it does not work well with data that is very uniform or similar— this would result in a lack of natural classes due to the lack in variance.</h3>

<h2>Ratios— Pretty Breaks</h2>
<h3>Pretty breaks uses round numbers to classify the data. A pro of pretty breaks is that it uses round numbers to create data that is easy to read and interpret. A con of pretty breaks is that it can be complicated to control the number of classes that you want, because pretty breaks relies on the creation of rounded numbers.</h3>
