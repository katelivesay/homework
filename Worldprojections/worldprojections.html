    <h1>In this project I learned how to display images in different projections</h1>
    
    <h2 style="color:red">How I displayed the map in different projections using QGIS</h2>
    <p>By using QGIS, I was able to project the world in different ways. In QGIS after uploading the Shape file of the world map, I was able to add a layer of caps and graticules that helped show the distortion to shape and size that the different projections created. Then, I went to the projection properties and was able to search for various world or regional projections by searching for the EPSG number. I saved each one as a PNG and then uploaded each one with a description to my HTML page through Github. Some of these projections have a more rectangular look, some more spherical, and some more rounded. Yet, each projection inevitably distorts the shape, area, distance, and direction of the world map. There are so many cool ways to map the world!</p>
    
    <h2>WGS84 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves the shape and area of the countries near the equator, yet it distorts the area and shape of the countries as you get closer to the poles. The countries near the poles are stretched vertically. For example, Antartica takes up the majority of bottom part of the map. Countries that are close to the equator remain the same in shape and size.</h3>

    <h2>Aitoff Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection shows a worldview map in a more spherical way than the WGS84 projections. Countries that are near the poles are still pretty stretched horizontally yet this map reveals those countries to be more spherical than the rather 2D projection of WGS84. This projection preserves the shape and area of countries that are in the very middle of the map, and distorts the shape, area, distance, and direction of countries as you go toward the poles and as you go East or West.</h3>

    <h2>Pseudo Mercator Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection keeps countries at the equator very similar in their original size and shape. Yet, as you get closer to the poles, the land masses start to increase. This is why Greenland is the size of the African continent, and why Antartica takes up nearly the entire bottom half of the map. This type of projection is very popular among major online map providers such as Google Maps, as it is good with navigation and direction. This projection preserves direction, which is good for navigation.</h3>

    <h2>EPSG 53018 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection shows a world map with a spherical shape and the countries that are near the poles are only slighter bigger than they should be. The countries on this map preserve their original size, despite the shape and area being distorted. Countries near the equator retain their original size and shape, in a more spherical way.</h3>

    <h2>EPSG 54034 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This map is more rectangular and represents countries with their preserved landmass areas, yet the shapes of the countries closer to the poles is distorted in a way that is stretched out vertically, as seen from the colored caps. As you go away from the poles, the shape is distorted significantly. </h3>

    <h2>EPSG 54027 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection preserves countries near the North Pole with countries retaining their same size and shape, yet as you enter down toward the South Pole, the land masses are distorted vertically and do not retain their size or shape at all. This map projects the Earth in a spherical way, looking more like a globe.</h3>

    </a>
    <h2>EPSG 102016 Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is very similar to the EPSG 54027 projection except for the fact that the landmass at the South Pole stretches all the way around the globe projection, unlike how in the other projection the land mass just suddenly stopped. The size, shape, and area of the countries closest to the North Pole are preserved, yet as you travel down to the South Pole, the area, shape, and direction are distorted.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Van der Grinten I Projection </h2>
    <h3>This projection maps the world in a spherical way, yet causes significant stretch toward the Poles and toward the outside of the map. This map preserves the area and shape of a country yet distorts the area and shape significantly as you go toward the poles and a little bit as you head East or West.</h3>

    <h2>Sphere Loximuthal Projection</h2>
    <h3>This projection is very similar to the Aitoff projection except that in this projection, the South Pole is significantly stretched, in a different way than the North Pole is stretched. This projection preserves the shape and area of countries that are near the very center of the map, yet distorts the size, shape, and area of countries, significantly as you head toward the poles.</h3>
