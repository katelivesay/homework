<h1>Homework 8: Geoproecssing Analysis </h1>

<h3>"How many green spaces exist near Wake County Public schools?"</h3>
<body>I chose to look at Wake County public schools and green spaces that exist near those schools. Studies show that the amount of green in and around schools has been linked with improved cognitive development, higher focus, and greater academic achievement. Also, green spaces fire imagination and creative thinking, which are both important for the academic success of young people. For each public school point, I created a buffer with a 1000m radius. I played around with the buffer, but came to the consensus that 1000m covered a pretty good geographical distance away from the school. I then found the intersect of those buffers with the green spaces/open space Shapefile from the Wake County government. I found that most public schools in Wake County come within 1000m of having a green space near them. There are only a handful of schools in which green spaces do not intersect with the school-buffer boundary. Although, a lot of schools have intentional green spaces around the school, such as elementary schools where the playgrounds are a vital aspect of the school.</body>
